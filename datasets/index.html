<h3> MCScript </h3>

<b>Description:</b> MCScript is a new dataset for the task of machine comprehension focussing on commonsense knowledge. Questions were collected based on script scenarios, rather than individual texts, which resulted in questionâ€“answer pairs that explicitly involve commonsense knowledge. It comprises 13,939 questions on 2,119 narrative texts and covers 110 different everyday scenarios. Each text is annotated with one of 110 scenarios. Questions are typed with a crowdsourced annotation, indicating whether they can be answered from the text or if commonsense knowledge is needed for finding an answer.
