				I am a computer science researcher  working in the area of <em>Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP)</em> and <em>Machine Learning (ML)</em>. 
				Currently, I am Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research (DR)</a>, Los Angeles. At DR I am conducting research in multi-modal affective computing, conversational systems and natural language understanding.

				I did my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/en/home.html">Saarland University</a>, Germany at <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/index.php?lang=en">Department of Computational Lingusitics</a> and <a href="https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/">Department of Computer Science</a>.

				During my Ph.D. I researched on modeling common sense knowledge about the world via <em>Scripts</em>. By scripts, I do not mean python scripts or movie scripts but Scripts are sequence of events representing a stereotypical activity for e.g. going to restaurant or making a coffee. My research focused on modeling scripts in terms of events governing the script. The idea was to learn good representations for events, which I refer as event embeddings (event vectors). The learned event embeddings capture the semantics of the event and can be used for other applications besides scripts.
