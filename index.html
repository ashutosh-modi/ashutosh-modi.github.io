				I did my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/">Saarland University</a>, Germany under the supervision of <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~pinkal/en/page.php">Prof. Dr. Manfred Pinkal </a> and <a href="http://ivan-titov.org/">Dr. Ivan Titov</a>. I was associated with <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/index.php?lang=en">Department of Computational Lingusitics</a>, <a href="http://www.mmci.uni-saarland.de/en/start">MultiModal Cluster Initiative (MMCI)</a> and <a href="https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/">Department of Computer Science</a>. During my doctoral studies I researched on modeling common sense knowledge about world via <a href="https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/bitstream/20.500.11880/26792/1/thesis.pdf"> <em> Scripts.</em></a>

				During my Ph.D. I researched on modeling common sense knowledge about the world via <em>Scripts</em>. By scripts, I do not mean python scripts or movie scripts but Scripts are sequence of events representing a stereotypical activity for e.g. going to restaurant or making a coffee. My research focused on modeling scripts in terms of events governing the script. The idea was to learn good representations for events, which I refer as event embeddings (event vectors). The learned event embeddings capture the semantics of the event and can be used for other applications besides scripts.
