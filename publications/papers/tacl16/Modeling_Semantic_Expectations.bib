        abstract = {Recent research in psycholinguistics has provided
increasing evidence that humans predict upcoming content. Prediction also
affects perception and might be a key to robustness in human language
processing. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect human
prediction by building a computational model that can predict upcoming
discourse referents based on linguistic knowledge alone vs. linguistic
knowledge jointly with common-sense knowledge in the form of scripts. We
find that script knowledge significantly improves model estimates of human
predictions. In a second study, we test the highly controversial hypothesis
that predictability influences referring expression type but do not find
evidence for such an effect.},
