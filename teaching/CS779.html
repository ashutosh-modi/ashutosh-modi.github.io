<h2 id="data_mcscript" style="color: orange;"> Statistical Natural Language Processing (CS779) : Fall 2020 </h2>

<!-- <h3 id="data_mcscript" style="color: blue;"> Webpage coming up soon </h3> -->

<h3 id="data_mcscript" style="color: black;"> Course Description:</h3>

        Natural  language  (NL)  refers  to  the  language  spoken/written  by  humans.   NL  is  the  primary  mode  ofcommunication for humans.  With the growth of the world wide web, data in the form of text has grownexponentially.  It calls for the development of algorithms and techniques for processing natural language forthe automation and development of intelligent machines.  This course will primarily focus on understandingand  developing  linguistic  techniques,  statistical  learning  algorithms  and  models  for  processing  language.We  will  have  a  statistical  approach  towards  natural  language  processing,  wherein  we  will  learn  how  onecould develop natural language understanding models from statistical regularities in large corpora of natural language texts while leveraging linguistics theories. </br>

        CS779 is a research project based course, participants are required to work on open and unsolved researchproblems in NLP and consequently considerable effort is expected from the participant.  As in the previousoffering of the course, work on the project can possibly lead to a publication.
